start where you are. this is very important. meditation practice is not about later, when you get it all together and you're this person you really respect. you may be the most violent person in the world--that's a fine place to start. that's a very rich place to start--juicy, smelly. you might be the most depressed person in the world, the most addicted person in the world, the most jealous person in the world. you might think that there are no others on the planet who hate themselves as much as you do. all of that is a good place to start. just where you are--that's the place to start. -Pema Chödrön
