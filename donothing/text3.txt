when people start to meditate or to work with any kind of spiritual discipline, they often think that somehow they're going to improve, which is a sort of subtle aggression against who they really are... But loving-kindness towards ourselves doesn't mean getting rid of anything. Maitri means that we can still be crazy after all these years. We can still be angry after all these years. We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthinesss. the point is not to try to change ourselves... it's about befriending who we are already. the ground of practice is you or me or whoever we are right now, just as we are. that's the ground, that's what we study, that's what we come to know with tremendous curiosity and interest. -Pema Chödrön
