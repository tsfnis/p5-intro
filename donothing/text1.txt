when you wake up in the morning and out of nowhere comes the heartache of alienation and loneliness, could you use that as a golden opportunity? rather than persecuting yourself or feeling that something terribly wrong is happening, right there in the moment of sadness and longing, could you relax and touch the limitless space of the human heart? the next time you get a chance, experiment with this. -Pema Chödrön
